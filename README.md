# Vladimir Zhelezarov
## Hardware-Software Bridge Engineer

I combine 9 years of hands-on industrial experience with modern software development to bridge the gap between hardware and software. I build robust solutions for real-world challenges—from the nacelle of a 2MW wind turbine to the browser.

✅ **Field-Tested:** 7 years as a service technician for wind turbines & B.Eng. in Digital Engineering completed while working full-time.

✅ **Results-Oriented:** Delivered impactful solutions with achievements like a 95% cost reduction in control hardware and performance improvements from 10 seconds to <100ms.

### 🎯 MY ENGINEERING PHILOSOPHY

My approach is built on a synthesis of two critical perspectives, treating hardware and software as one continuous system.

*   **Grounded in Physical Reality:** My 7 years in the field, often under harsh conditions, taught me the tangible cost of downtime, the physics of mission-critical systems, and the paramount importance of reliability. When I write code, I'm always thinking about the machine it will run on and the environment it will operate in.

*   **Architected for Digital Efficiency:** My development work is driven by the principles of performance, clean architecture, and scalability. I see opportunities to automate, optimize algorithms, and build maintainable digital systems that solve physical-world problems.

This synthesis allows me to build solutions that are both robust and intelligent. I design software with a deep understanding of its physical constraints and architect hardware interactions with an eye for digital scalability. The result is a more resilient, efficient, and cohesive final product.

### 🏆 QUANTIFIED IMPACT

**INDUSTRIAL INNOVATION:**
*   Replaced expensive wind turbine control panels with a custom smartphone [solution](https://github.com/vlzware/BTDisplayOSS), achieving a **95% cost reduction**.
*   Developed a Bluetooth signal management [system](https://github.com/vlzware/SmartHubOSS) to replace failure-prone mechanical slip rings, improving diagnostics and uptime.
*   Created a real-time hydraulic simulation of a 2MW turbine's pitch system, enabling safe team training for complex faults [video here](https://youtu.be/gWOjZWlv_fs) without risk to the team or the live equipment.

**SOFTWARE OPTIMIZATION:**
*   **Web Client Performance:** Improved load times of a complex industrial visualization client from **10s → <100ms** (closed source).
*   **C++ File Processing:** Automated a manual data sanitation process, reducing execution time from **1 day → 200 seconds** (closed source).
*   **Browser-Based Innovation:** Devised a method for secure local IP detection without violating browser security policies (closed source).

### 🎯 WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR

A new professional challenge with hardware-software integration at its core. I thrive in medium-sized, technology-oriented companies that value quality and long-term thinking. I am open to roles in Germany or fully remote positions that welcome self-initiative and encourage process improvement.
